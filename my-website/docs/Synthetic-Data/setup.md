# Setup

Basically, only a couple of things are needed to start using the **Synthetic Data Generator**

- Local Store
- Data Tools Plugin

## Local Store

The local store is a folder on your laptop. If you have not done so already, please make an empty folder and add this as your local store.

## Data Tools Plugin

If you have not installed the Data Tools Plugin, please go ahead and install it.
