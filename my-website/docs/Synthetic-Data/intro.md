# Synthetic Data Generator

Capella DataStudio's Synthetic Data Generator is designed to empower developers with a seamless, no-code way to create realistic and meaningful data for their projects. Whether you’re testing applications, training machine learning models, or simulating large-scale systems, this feature provides unparalleled flexibility and power.

# What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is not just "fake" data; it’s designed to mimic the properties, distributions, and relationships of real-world data. While fake data might generate random values without context, synthetic data aims to:

- Maintain logical relationships between fields (e.g., city and state are consistent).
- Follow realistic distributions, such as generating values that adhere to normal or weighted distributions.
- Be statistically relevant for testing, analysis, and simulation.
- This makes synthetic data incredibly useful in scenarios where real data is unavailable, sensitive, or insufficient.

# Key Features of Capella DataStudio's Synthetic Data Generator

## Realistic, Correlated Data

Our generator ensures data relationships are meaningful. For example, addresses include matched city, state, zip code, latitude, and longitude values. Names and demographics are logically consistent.

## Built-in Typesets, Fully Configurable

Choose from a wide array of built-in typesets to jumpstart your data generation. Each type can be customized to suit your specific needs, whether it’s names, locations, dates, or numeric fields.

## Extendible: Bring Your Own Typesets

Got your own datasets or specific requirements? Import custom typesets to extend the generator’s capabilities and create tailored data that fits your unique use case.

## Primary Key / Foreign Key Relationships

Model complex datasets with ease by defining relationships between fields. Foreign keys can reference primary key data, enabling realistic relational data structures.

## Expression Handling with Powerful Functions

Leverage built-in functions to create complex expressions without writing a single line of code. Combine and manipulate fields dynamically for ultimate control over your data.

## No Restrictions on Data Size

Generate data at any scale, from a few rows for small tests to millions of documents for large-scale simulations. There are no limits to what you can create.

## Seamless Integration with Capella and Couchbase Server

Take your synthetic data further by importing it directly into Capella Operational or Couchbase Server. This ensures a streamlined workflow from generation to deployment.
