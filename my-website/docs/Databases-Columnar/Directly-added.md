# Directly added from UI

What if all the Databases, Links etc are all created directly from the UI?<br />
In this case, while you cannot add Collections from the UI, remember:

- All other actions like connect, delete etc still apply
- You must still **Refresh** Scopes to get the **Sample Document** and **Schema**

## Example UI

Here is an example of the UI where all the assets have been directly created using Columnar UI
![sai-ui](/img/columnar/sai-ui.png)

## Example Schema

And the Schema:
