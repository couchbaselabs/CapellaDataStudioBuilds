## Connect Form

The above example shows a connection to a Capella Columnar Instance.
- Columnar URL: Cut and paste the complete URL of your Capella Columnar instances
- The userid/password are your Capella Columnar UI login

## The Connection Process

- Capella DataStudio connects to the instance using the form details.
- It fetches the details of all the existing databases (scopes and collections)
- The list of databases is fetched **only** at connection time.
  - Any databases added from the Capella Columnar UI will not get reflected in Capella DataStudio. In this case, you will have to **refresh** the connection.
- All details are kept in a encrypted _DataStudio Store_ locally.

## Post Connection

If your connection is successful, you will see the details in the Main Panel.

Lets now take a look at the details provided

### The Connection Row

Use the **Radio Button** on the start of the row to choose the connection.

- This now is the **Active Connection**
  The row shows the details, including the services which this instance is running.
  At the end of the row, there are 3 action buttons:
- **Refresh**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_ and reconnects. YOu will typically be using this under these scenarios:
  - Databases have been added/deleted directly from the Capella UI
- **Edit**: This only allows you to change the userid/password.
- **Delete**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_. Note that this action has no effect on the actual cluster itself.

### The AppBar

The AppBar shows the details of the **Active Connection**
It also shows the **Active Database** (aka Bucket) and the **Active Scope**

- These are chosen randomly during the connection process.
- Remember to set them from the **Databases** menu option fromm the NavBar

### The Footer Tables

These show some details of the instance, like the number of nodes, their CPU and RAM usage.
The tables also show the existing buckets.

## Tip
