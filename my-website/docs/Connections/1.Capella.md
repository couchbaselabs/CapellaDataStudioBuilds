# Capella Clusters

Connect to a Capella Provisoned Cluster

:::danger[Take care]
Before trying to connect to a Capella Cluster, make sure that you have at least 1 bucket in the cluster.
:::

## Connecting to Capella Clusters (aka Capella Provisioned)

From the **Add Connection** drop-down button, choose Capella Provisioned
![Capella](/img/connect/capella-connect.png)

## Prerequisites

Before Connecting, make sure that you have configured your Capella Instance with:

- **Allowed IP**: Add your Client (Mac) IP address to the list of allowed IPs
- **Database Credentials**: Create database credentials and choose the buckets (databases) this can access. A good idea, initially, is to add all buckets and give Read/Write access to all scopes within the buckets.

## Connect Form

The above example shows a connection to a Capella Cluster.

- You can specify any name to the connection. This cannot be changed later.
- Enter the endpoint of the cluster
  :::info
  The Capella Connect Tab shows the SDK Endpoint. This typically starts with couchbases://. The _endpoint_ is the string which comes after this. So, do **not** include couchbases://
  :::
- The userid/password are your database credentials
- The Cloud provider is for display purposes only.
- Capella DataStudio come bundled with the SSL certificate automatically.
  :::info
  If you enter the wrong endpoint or wrong userid/password, an appropriate error message will pop up.

## The Connection Process

- Capella DataStudio connects to the cluster using the form details.
- It fetches the details of all the existing buckets (scopes and collections)
- The list of buckets is fetched **only** at connection time.
  - Any buckets added from the Capella UI will not get reflected in Capella DataStudio. In this case, you will have to **refresh** the connection.
- All details are kept in a encrypted _DataStudio Store_ locally.

## Post Connection

If your connection is successful, you will see the details in the Main Panel.

Lets now take a look at the details provided

### The Connection Row

Use the **Radio Button** on the start of the row to choose the connection.

- This now is the **Active Connection**
  The row shows the details, including the services which this cluster is running.
  At the end of the row, there are 3 action buttons:

- **Refresh**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_ and reconnects. YOu will typically be using this under these scenarios:
  - Buckets have been added/deleted directly from the Capella UI
  - The cluster topology has changed, either by adding or taking away nodes
- **Edit**: This only allows you to change the userid/password.
- **Delete**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_. Note that this action has no effect on the actual cluster itself.

### The AppBar

The AppBar shows the details of the **Active Connection**
It also shows the **Active Database** (aka Bucket) and the **Active Scope**

- These are chosen randomly during the connection process.
- Remember to set them from the **Databases** menu option fromm the NavBar

### The Footer Tables

These show some details of the cluster, like the number of nodes, their CPU and RAM usage.

- Currently, these values are the ones got at connection time only and are not refreshed.

The tables also show the existing buckets and their quotas.

## Tip

Set the **Active Connection** Context from this UI.
