# Self Managed Couchbase

Connect to your Couchbase Self Managed Cluster

:::danger[Take care]
Before trying to connect to a Couchbase Cluster, make sure that you have at least 1 bucket in the cluster.
:::

## Connecting to Self Managed Couchbase Clusters

From the **Add Connection** drop-down button, choose Couchbase Self Managed
![Self Managed](/img/connect/self-managed-connect.png)

## Connect Form

<img src="/img/connect/self-managed-connect-form.png" width="400" alt="Self Managed Form" />
The above example shows a connection to a cluster running on VMs, so the IP address and one node has been specified.<br />
If your self managed cluster is runnning on Cloud, AWS for instance, enter the hostname of any node in the cluster.<br />
If you are running Couchbase Server on Docker, you can enter _localhost_ as hostname<br />
The **SSL certificate** is optional.
:::info

- If you enter the wrong IP address or wrong userid/password, an appropriate error message will pop up.
- If using SSL, make sure the appropriate ports are open, for example: 11207 etc. Refer Couchbase Server documentation for a full list of ports used by SSL.

## The Connection Process

- Capella DataStudio connects to the cluster using the form details.
- It fetches the details of all the existing buckets (scopes and collections)
- The list of buckets is fetched **only** at connection time.
  - Any buckets added from the Couchbase UI will not get reflected in Capella DataStudio. In this case, you will have to **refresh** the connection.
- All details are kept in a encrypted _DataStudio Store_ locally.

## Post Connection

If your connection is successful, you will see the details in the Main Panel.

Lets now take a look at the details provided

### The Connection Row

Use the **Radio Button** on the start of the row to choose the connection.

- This now is the **Active Connection**
  The row shows the details, including the services which this cluster is running.
  At the end of the row, there are 3 action buttons:
- **Refresh**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_ and reconnects. YOu will typically be using this under these scenarios:
  - Buckets have been added/deleted directly from the Couchbase Server UI
  - The cluster topology has changed, either by adding or taking away nodes
- **Edit**: This only allows you to change the userid/password.
- **Delete**: This deletes all the connection details from the _DataStudio Store_. Note that this action has no effect on the actual cluster itself.

### The AppBar

The AppBar shows the details of the **Active Connection**
It also shows the **Active Database** (aka Bucket) and the **Active Scope**

- These are chosen randomly during the connection process.
- Remember to set them from the **Databases** menu option fromm the NavBar

### The Footer Tables

These show some details of the cluster, like the number of nodes, their CPU and RAM usage.

- Currently, these values are the ones got at connection time only and are not refreshed.
  The tables also show the existing buckets and their quotas.

## Tip

:::tip[Tip]

Set the **Active Connection** Context from this UI.
