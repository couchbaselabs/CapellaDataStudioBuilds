## Install Capella DataStudio

Downoad the product from the home page<br />
Unzip the downloaded zip file<br />
Move or Copy the **Capella DataStudio** application to ~/Applications folder. Just the Application alone, not the entire folder!<br />
Execute Capella DataStudio from here
:::info[Take care]
If you attempt to run it from the downloaded folder, it will pop up a error message:
<img src="/img/start/update-error.png" width="200" alt="update-error" />
:::
The first time you open, it may pop up a box:
<img src="/img/start/open-warning.png" width="200" alt="open-warning" />

- This is a normal warning for Mac Apps not downloaded from the MacStore

On opening the Application from ~/Applications, you will see:
<img src="/img/start/first-open.png" width="600" alt="first-open" />
If you see this, then the Product is successfully installed
