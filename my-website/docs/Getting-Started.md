:::danger[Disclaimers]

- Capella DataStudio is still an experimental project
  - This means that features are being rapidly added redesigned, and so the initial period may have breaking changes.
- Capella DataStudio is **not** an officially supported product of Couchbase
- This is in active development with frequent updates. While decent amount of testing is done, please expect bugs!
- Depending on users interest, this may be formally "productized" ... no decisions yet.
